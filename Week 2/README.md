# Week 2 - Dyslexia Awareness Month
Week 2 of #OpenScienceOctober features the [Vocabulary and Comprehension (VoCo) project](https://www.ldbase.org/datasets/38a9b8a2-65e3-425a-8480-5d3e94b37f45) for Dyslexia Awareness Month!

# Project Description
The VoCo project was a small study of struggling readers in Grade 9. The treatment group received a multicomponent reading intervention delivered over 80 sessions during one year. Data on reading comprehension and fluence were collected and pre- and post-test. 

*Note*: This dataset was selected for Dyslexia Awareness Month because all the participants in this study were low in reading comprehension, however it should be noted that they did not self-report, nor did the authors have access to, whether or not they have a specific learning disorder. Additionally, the authors of this project tagged the dataset under “Reading Disability”. If you are curious about how dyslexia is currently conceptualized and a suggested reframe of these conceptualizations, please consider reading this short commentary on the matter:

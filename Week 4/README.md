# Week 4 - Longitudinal Data
Week 4 of #OpenScienceOctober features the [Western Reserve Reading and Math Project](https://www.ldbase.org/projects/d5421a93-a9d5-415f-b56b-f9c56ed9e9cc)!

# Project Description

**LDbase Project Page**: [Western Reserve Reading and Math Project (WRRMP)](https://www.ldbase.org/projects/d5421a93-a9d5-415f-b56b-f9c56ed9e9cc)

The Western Reserve Reading and Math Project (WRRMP) is a NIH funded longitudinal study on child development. The project has collected data **annually for 15 years**, with data on approximately **450 twin pairs** collected during this time. The project has had several focal points throughout its history. The first phase of the project focused on **environmental influences of early reading and mathematics**, in particular taking advantage of the twin nature to use a genetically sensitive design. The second phase of the project focused on **systematic developmental genetic examination of reading comprehension** as it relates to component language and reading skills such as **oral language skills, decoding skills, and several behavioral measures**. This phase additionally includes several mathematics measures of interest. The most recent phase has focused on the study of **brain functioning** as it relates to math and reading problem solving.

The project contains 10 waves of data, with a variety of reading, math, environmental, and behavioral measures. Data includes measures related reading comprehension, linguistic comprehension, vocabulary, decoding skills, phonological awareness, reading fluency, and other reading related measures. Math data includes measures related to math performance, number sense, calculation and arithmetic, math fluency, and other mathematics related measures. Behavioral data include measures related to ADHD hyperactivity and inattention related behaviors, child attachment, anxiety, executive function, temperament, attitudes and motivation, and other behavior related measures. Several demographic and environmental measures are also available. The data contained is sufficient enough to answer a wide variety of questions related to reading, mathematics, and behavioral data, as well as overlap in any of the constructs.

# Dataset

## Consider This When Engaging with the Data
This dataset contains all longitudinal data for the entirety of the WRRMP. This includes 10 waves worth of twin data, with extensive reading, math, behavioral, and environmental measures. Due to the twin nature of the data, data is presented as both long and wide, with each twin represented twice within the dataset.

This data set contains information for > 10,000 variables. Thus, it may be useful to first subset to only those variables you are interested in before creating your data visualization. However, make sure to preserve the original data in case you need to go back to it!

If you are only interested in looking at data for a particular wave and/or measure, navigate to the [main Project page](https://www.ldbase.org/projects/d5421a93-a9d5-415f-b56b-f9c56ed9e9cc) to find individual data sets and codebooks. 

Finally, be sure to cite the data set in your visualization and/or accompanying post on social media (see Citation below!)
